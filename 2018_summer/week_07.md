# Week 7 Status Update

I proceeded to work on the front end of the schedule page, but ran into issues regarding its back end that I had set up in the past.
I will need to go back to it and fix it, as the data is not being shown properly.
I also need to fill in the previous weeks as I skipped out on a quite the few.

Though looking at the date when I wrote week 1, this file is week 7, yet someone else stated its week 8. I think I might have to recheck the weeks.
