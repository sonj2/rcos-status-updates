# Week 3 Status Update

I  started the week with a major blockker: the laptop did not work. It was a connection issue with the hard drive, and the laptop did not work until the thursday of the week.
On thursday itself, I was informed that I will be working on the front end of the website. Other than finishing up the backend for the game, I need to start learning about Vue and Bootstrap.
Onsen, on the other hand, is being dropped as its visual libraries are solely for mobile applications.
