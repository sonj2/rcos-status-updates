# Week 02 Status Update

Well, I forgot to make the week 1 update, so I did that. The PHP code for the schedule page is going on, mostly working and should be finished soon.
The main blocker for this week was the laptop failing to boot for the majority of the week as it could not detect the SSD.
For the future, I would start getting around using Vue JS and Onsen UI for the front end, both the desktop version of the site and the mobile version.
